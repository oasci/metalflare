# Methods

This folder will contain information needed to reproduce experiments, information that would eventually end up in the material and method section of a paper.

It is good practice to keep the information up to date and to enter information as soon as possible.
For instance, reagents shall be best documented at the time of purchase.

More can be added and documented with numbers `02` to `98`.
