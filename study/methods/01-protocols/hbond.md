# Hydrogen bond

A hydrogen bond of X&ndash;H $\cdots$ Y&ndash;Z, where X is the donor and Y is the acceptor atom, can be classified based on distances and angles.
One characteristic recommended by IUPAC is that the H $\cdots$ Y distance is less than the sum of H and Y van der Waals radii.
Hydrogen (1.10 Å) and oxygen (1.52 Å) [^mantina2009consistent] would have a cutoff of 2.62 Å.
Others recommend a cutoff of 2.50 Å [^hubbard2010hydrogen] based on structural analysis [^mcdonald1994satisfying] and quantum chemical calculations [^liu2008geometrical].
Since the difference between a 2.5 and 2.62 Å cutoff is likely a substantially weak hydrogen bond, we will use **a H $\cdots$ Y cutoff of 2.5 Å**.
