> Various probability distribution functions aggregated over all production MD simulations.
> **(A)** Cα Distance between Cys147 and Cys204.
> **(B)** Psi dihedral angle of Cro66 (i.e., between atoms N3-CA3-C3-N).
> **(C-H)** Distance from a hydrogen atom from the specified residue to the closest acceptor atom on Cro66.
> All x-axes are from 1.0 to 8.0 Å unless specified otherwise.
