> Probability densities aggregated over all production MD simulations.
> **(A)** CÎ± Distance between Cys147 and Cys204.
> **(B)** $\Psi$ dihedral angle of Cro66.
> **(C-E)** Hydrogen bond distance from Thr203, Tyr145, and His148 to the Cro66 phenolate oxygen, respectively.
> **(F)** Structural depiction of the deprotonated (anionic) roGFP2 chromophore in its phenolate form, highlighting the $\Psi$ dihedral angle and key surrounding residues involved in chromophore stabilization and fluorescence.
