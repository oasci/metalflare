# Literature

There is no one best way to keep track of literature for a project.
Many prefer using a citation manager like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), [EndNote](https://endnote.com/), [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/), [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/), or the countless others.
This decision is entirely up to personal taste, but we provide another option within Obsidian.
Because why not.

In this repository, we have included a custom [BibTex file adder](https://github.com/oasci/obsidian-bibtex-adder) that will automatically add references to a BibTex from just the DOI of the article.
After activating the `BibTeX Adder` community plugin, you can use the `BibTeX Adder: Add BibTeX entry from DOI` command.
Alternatively, you can click on the paper airplane icon on the left ribbon.
By entering the DOI (without any url information), it will query Crossref and add the BibTeX entry to [`refs.bib`](refs.bib).

!!! note
    Always verify the BibTeX entry formatting and accuracy.
